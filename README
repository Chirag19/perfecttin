Decisite reads a point cloud in LAS or PLY format and outputs a TIN in DXF format which approximates the point cloud to within a vertical tolerance.

Before compiling Decisite, if you want it to read PLY files, clone the libplyxx repo from github.com/phma and compile and install it. This is Simon Rajotte's code; I just made it installable.

To compile, if you're not developing the program:
1. Create a subdirectory build/ inside the directory where you untarred the source code.
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make

If you are developing the program:
1. Create a directory build/decisite outside the directory where you cloned the source code.
2. cd build/decisite
3. cmake <directory where the source code is>
4. make

PLY and DXF files have no units in them. LAS files do, but I haven't yet figured out whether they're always in meters or the unit is indicated in the variable-length record. The DXF file output is in the same unit as the input.
