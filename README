PerfectTIN reads a point cloud in LAS or PLY format and outputs a TIN in DXF format and text TIN format which approximates the point cloud to within a vertical tolerance.

Before compiling PerfectTIN, if you want it to read PLY files, clone the libplyxx repo from github.com/phma and compile and install it. This is Simon Rajotte's code; I just made it installable.

If building on MinGW, clone the repo https://github.com/meganz/mingw-std-threads and put it beside this one.

To compile, if you're not developing the program:
1. Create a subdirectory build/ inside the directory where you untarred the source code.
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make

If you are developing the program:
1. Create a directory build/decisite outside the directory where you cloned the source code.
2. cd build/decisite
3. cmake <directory where the source code is>
4. make

PLY and DXF files have no units in them. LAS files may have the unit indicated in the variable-length record, but PerfectTIN ignores it. You can specify the units on the command line with the -u option.
